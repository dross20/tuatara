## ðŸ¦Ž What is Tuatara?

Tuatara is a library for generating fine-tuning pairs for large language model (LLM) post training.

## ðŸ¤” Why Tuatara?

Fine-tuning large language models requires high-quality training data pairs that are well grounded in their source documents. Creating these pairs manually is laborious and error-prone, and existing tools often lack flexibility or fail to scale across different document types and domains. Tuatara addresses these challenges directly.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
Run the following command to install Tuatara:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/dross20/tuatara
```

## ðŸš€ Quickstart
The following example demonstrates how to use Tuatara's preconfigured pipeline for creating fine tuning pairs from multiple documents. By default, `default_pipeline` will use the OpenAI API for LLM inference and search for your OpenAI API key in the environment variables.

```python
from tuatara import default_pipeline

documents = [
  "./document1.pdf",
  "./document2.pdf",
  "./document3.txt"
]

pipeline = default_pipeline(model="gpt-4o")
pairs, history = pipeline(documents)
```
